# Bokang's AI Assistant

## Overview

Welcome to my AI Assistant, a personal AI companion designed to showcase my skills and experiences in data science and Machine Learning. This project demonstrates my ability to create intelligent, interactive web applications that leverage cutting-edge AI technologies.

## Purpose

I created this LLM (Large Language Model) project with a specific goal in mind: to provide recruiters and talent specialists with an innovative and engaging way to get to know me better. By interacting with this AI assistant, you can:

- Learn about my professional experiences and projects
- Understand my approach to problem-solving in data science and AI
- Get a sense of my creativity and passion for technology

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web application and includes the necessary scripts.
2. `styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the visual styling of the application, creating an engaging and responsive user interface.
3. `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the interactive elements of the application, including the particle animation and integration with the Voiceflow chat widget.
